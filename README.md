# Cannon & commerce
This is a demo game about sailing and shipping goods between islands. Currently, in the game, there are 9 islands, and only 7 of them have ports. 

Contracts are generated randomly. When a player's reputation is zero or less, no one trusts long-range shipping, so at first, the player would deliver worthless cargo to the nearest port.

When the player’s reputation is higher than zero, contractors can offer to deliver more valuable cargo and also to remote islands. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the demo, and some features aren't implemented yet, or are implemented... let’s say, incorrectly. Currently map has known bug (when player travels too far accuracy drops).
